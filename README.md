# SIMOS: Simulation Operating System for AI Agents

## Overview
SIMOS (Simulation Operating System) is a powerful AI Simulation Operating System designed to manage and operate AI Agents within simulated and real-world environments. 

SIMOS is at the heart of the SIPHER//AGI ecosystem. It's built to empower developers to create sophisticated AI Agents capable of learning, adapting, and interacting in complex environments. 

SIMOS handles everything from processing real-time game states to managing agent memories and decision-making processes. It bridges the gap between advanced AI models (LLMs) and interactive applications like games, providing a seamless integration that brings AI companions to life.

## Features

### Current Features (as of January 14, 2025)

*   **Agent Memory System**: A core feature of SIMOS, this system allows AI companions to retain information about past interactions. This enables them to grow with players, participate in narrative events, and build more meaningful relationships, enriching the overall experience.
*   **[In-Development] Real-Time Agent State Tracking**:  SIMOS is being enhanced to provide live monitoring of AI Agent states. This will give developers and users valuable insights into agent performance and status.


### Future Potential Features

These features represent potential future developments for SIMOS and the broader ecosystem:

#### **SIMOS-Related Potential Features**

*   **Agent Personality System**: This system would add unique personality traits to AI Agents, managed by SIMOS, influencing their interactions and behaviors within the game.
*   **Agent Relationship System**: This feature would enable the tracking and management of relationships between players and AI Agents, with relationship data potentially stored and processed within SIMOS, impacting gameplay and story outcomes.
*   **Shared Progression Links**: This system would allow for player stats and actions to influence AI Agent attributes, potentially managed through SIMOS, creating a deeper connection between player and companion.
*   **Talent Trees**: Customizable talent trees for AI Agents, providing strategic development options that could be managed and tracked by SIMOS.
*   **Permanent Companion Upgrades via Blockchain**: SIMOS could potentially integrate with blockchain technology to manage long-term AI Agent progression and upgrades, especially in new game+ scenarios.

#### **Related Potential Features**

Features not directly implemented in SIMOS, but highlight the potential future applications and interactions of AI Agents managed by the platform.

*   **AI Agent Lore Integration**: In-game events and narratives that could be influenced by AI Agent data stored and processed within SIMOS.
*   **Companion Quests**: Personalized quests for AI Agents, potentially generated or managed with the assistance of SIMOS's capabilities.
*   **Content Creation Documentation**: Documentation to guide the development of AI Agent content, potentially including guidelines for integrating with SIMOS.
*   **In-Game Moonbase Reactive Environment Automa Interactions**: Environmental features within Moonbase that react to AI Agents, showcasing the dynamic behaviors facilitated by SIMOS.
*   **AI Gaming Agent Showcase Platform (Moonbase)**: Although technically a Moonbase feature, this platform relies on AI Agents developed and managed by SIMOS. It allows players to create and share custom AI Agents, demonstrating the power and flexibility of SIMOS.
*   **AI Game Modes (Sipher Odyssey)**: These new game modes within Sipher Odyssey showcase the capabilities of AI companions developed using SIMOS, enhancing player engagement.
